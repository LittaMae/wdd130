                <p>Hello everyone! I'm Tammi Enkey. I live in Rexburg with my three sons who are Joseph, Samuel, and Malachi. They go by Joe, Sam, and Kai.
                    I'm originally from Albertson, North Carolina. It's a small town in the middle of no where. It's a farming community. The people there are just so good
                    and willing to give anyone the shirt off of their back. My grandparents had the largest family in the area so the town is full of a lot of my family
                    members.
                </p>
                <!---<p>I work at BYU-Idaho as the CIT Office Assistant. I've enjoyed taking classes on the side that are in relation to the CIT department. I now
                    understand more of what students are learning and am able to help them more as well.
                </p>--->
                <p>I love going on adventures in the outdoors with my boys. We enjoy hiking, camping, kayaking, swimming, sledding, cross-country skiing, going to parks, 
                    having picnics, visiting national parks, and so much more. Aside from spending a lot of time with my kids, I also enjoy dancing, listening to general 
                    conference on long walks, teaching the four year olds in primary, spending time with friends, helping others, and just living life.
                </p>
                <p>I have a strong testimony of my Savior, Jesus Christ. You never know how much you need Him until you experience tragedy. He's been
                    at my side every step of the way. I chose to turn to Him during my darkest moments and I'll never regret it. He truly is the answer
                    to everything. He has my heart and always will! I'm so grateful for my testimony and for the strength that it gives me each day to just keep doing the
                    best that I can.
                </p>
